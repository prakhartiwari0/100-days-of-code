# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Days Before the Day 0
**Journey till now** : (I was studying for Class 11 JEE till about the first week of August 2022, but something very bad happens which made me to kickstart my journey in tech, basically for money, but my actual aim was & is never like that, I always loved computers, coding & tech basically, and this emergency like situation just worked like a spark to an already existing bag of fuel) So I started, or to be precise, re-continued learning web development in a structured and disciplined manner from the Complete Web Development Bootcamp 2022 by Angela Yu course on Udemy. I got to know about it from Ishan Sharma on YouTube, and decided to shape up my learning so that I don't get stuck in the **tutorial hell** (lessons from past ðŸ™ƒ) and learn in a structured manner and treat her like my Mentor. I completed the HTML, CSS, and Web Design parts very nicely, in a few days only, because I was already knowing the basic stuff. I got to know about many new *cool* things and was enjoyinig my journey **until** something unexpected happened... <br>
I entered the JavaScript module and got **confused** and **lost**. I searched the internet and got to know that her course was actually very outdated, my motivation level suddenly dropped, and I was again lost like before. I was not learning anything new now, I was just roaming and roaming to get the best resource to learn JavaScript. <br>
Meanwhile, I was making an **online presence** of myself, and was **exploring** and learning many new things about this whole thing called social media **networking**, **open source**, **learning in public** and more! I recreated my Twitter profile, I worked on my website while learning webdev, created some other profiles and learnt about blogging and more. I also created my **[first pull request](https://firstpr.me/#prakhartiwari0)** on 15 August 2022 which eventually got merged under a day! it was a very very small contribution, but the level of happiness I had after I did that was **great**. I felt that I have did something which is **meaningful**, and now I am actually starting my journey in tech. <br>
Fast forwarding a few days of wasting time on the internet and some other stuff (anxiety, existential crisis, self-exploration, future planning, confusion, and what not) I got to know about **The Odin Project (TOP)**, and after some research, I finally decided to learn through this thing. It is a very good resource because it actually redirects me to many cool places to learn about a topic, and prompts me to research myself the topics and learn about them as I would in daily coding like as a developer, according to their [claim](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-introduction-to-web-development#why-odin). I will also be using some other resources like https://javascript.info/, and some YouTube Videos, but the end goal is to learn JavaScript very well so that I could make some real world projects that could really give **value to people** and try to _make this world a better place_! <br>
And of course, the super end goal in WebDev is to learn **Full Stack Web Development**, and work on my own ideas, apply for **internships**, gain **experience** and get known in the **Tech community**. <br>

And yeah one thing I forgot to mention is that I also created a YouTube channel with a unique name and style. I will be working on that to share and teach what I am learning so that I could help people in need, and also make myself better by teaching the concepts. Will share the name after I have achieved some milestones ðŸ˜‰


### Day 0: August 28, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I finally learnt CSS-Flexbox thoroughly with some deeper insights.

**Thoughts:** I shouldn't learn in one go, I did this today and got burnt out, but I did this for a reason. For a lot of days I was procrastinating to move forward in my learning, and I was having a feeling of incompleteness which was making me anxious and uncomfortable. After I have learnt Flexbox with good notes that have really cleared a lot of confusions, and concepts + some minute things I didn't knew before, I am now satisfied.
From now onwards, I will be regularly learning Web Development. I will divide my learning time in two parts-
1. HTML and Responsive CSS Practice - Half of the time I will be practicing HTML CSS and make projects, solve frontendmentor.io challenges, make my own website better.
2. Learn JavaScript - The next half I will be moving forward with JS language, the thing I am really excited and was waiting for!

I completed the basic modules (Introduction, Prerequisites, Git Basics, HTML & CSS Foundations, FlexBox) of **TOP** very quickly because most of the stuff I already knew. But a few things they taught were so good that made me believe it is a great resource and I was doing the real self-learning. I got to know about a few things about Git that I didn't knew before (yesterday)

**Self-Learning** is not about watching tutorials and following them blindly, making the projects they tell you to make with a good guidance and resources. Most Tutorials are actually, what I will called, corrupted, how? They are corrupted with biases, incomplete knowledge, inauthenticity, and much more! You don't know if the person teaching you the topic is somebody who actually have the same needs as of you, have done a good amount of study and has experience, and is actually guiding you correctly. <br>
I was never interested in making projects by following the tutorials, I find it super boring and worthless, I could watch a few just to get an idea or some kind of help, but I never built a single project which was told by somebody on YouTube. <br>

**Real Self-Learning** is when you yourself read (documentation or some authentic resource), practice, experiment and code. You can watch _some_ YouTube videos from authentic Creators for clearing your concepts, for example Kevin Powell is a really great person to learn CSS from, he teaches the concepts so nicely and deeply, that if you learn from him about some concepts that you struggle in, you will feel satisfied. But whatever maybe the case, searching the GOOGLE, Reading Docs, Learning from Stackoverflow, and other authentic websites, articles, GitHub, and most importantly, practicing and building stuff on your own is the best way to learn coding/webdev.

### Day 0: September 01, 2022

**Today's Progress**: I have started JavaScript! I already know the basics of programming so it quite easy, but still, I am focusing on the basics. I learnt about Variables, Consts, Numbers, Operators.

**Thoughts:** Well, I need to sincerely devote the time that I give to learning this. And I also have to focus on my studies...Huh the life is soooo umm I don't know.... Amazing? Lost? Confusing? What is this world? Who am I? Why am I? Aaah soo weird but unique. Listening to the music of Kimi no Na wa, it is pretty amazing.
